'''what is Programming? --> Programming is a set of instructions that are given to a computer to execute something.
what is Python? --> Python is a scripting,programming,general based,highlevel programming language.
what is Scripting Language? --> Any programming language that is interpreted is called a Scripting Language.
what is an interpreter? --> It converts the high level code to machine code(low level code) line by line.
What is an Translator? --> Any device that may be a compiler , interpreter , assembler that converts high level code to low level code is called a translator.
Is python Dynamic? --> Yes,Python is a dynamic programming language because we don't need to give datatype of a variable in python as it takes automatically.
In python,DataTypes are classes and methods are objects.
To know the datatype of a variable we need to use type(variable name).
